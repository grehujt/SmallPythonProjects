# Making Prediction Based On Curve Fitting

_NOTE: this example is taken from **Building Machine Learning System in Python**._

### Key points
- Basic feelings on machine learning system.
    1. data cleaning
    2. feature engineering
    3. data modeling
    4. models evaluation
- Basic usages of curve fitting functions in scipy.
- Basic usages of data visualization of matplotlib.

### Scenario
- We are running a website, as time goes by, an increasing number of users are attracted by our website.
- We are going to allocate resources (more servers) to make our clients happy.
- But we do not want to waste money on allocating too many resources.
- We have a [tsv](./web_traffic.tsv) (tab-seperated values) file, which contains the web stats for last month. And each line contains the hour consecutively and number of page views in that hour.
- We want to know in advance when our current limit will be hit (10k requests per hour).

### Step-by-step solution
1. Data cleaning.
    + Load & view the data:
    
        ```python
        data = sp.genfromtxt('web_traffic.tsv', delimiter='\t')
        print data.shape
        print data[:10]
        ```

        >     (743, 2)
        >     [[  1.00000000e+00   2.27200000e+03]
        >      [  2.00000000e+00              nan]
        >      [  3.00000000e+00   1.38600000e+03]
        >      [  4.00000000e+00   1.36500000e+03]
        >      [  5.00000000e+00   1.48800000e+03]
        >      [  6.00000000e+00   1.33700000e+03]
        >      [  7.00000000e+00   1.88300000e+03]
        >      [  8.00000000e+00   2.28300000e+03]
        >      [  9.00000000e+00   1.33500000e+03]
        >      [  1.00000000e+01   1.02500000e+03]]
    
    + Find out if we can drop the 'nan' data:

        ```python
        x = data[:, 0]
        y = data[:, 1]
        print sp.sum(sp.isnan(y)) # 8
        ```

        In this case, we have 8 nan out of 743 samples, we can afford to drop them.

    + Data clean up:
    
        ```python
        x = x[~sp.isnan(y)]
        y = y[~sp.isnan(y)]
        ```

    + Visulise the data to get a feeling:

        ```python
        plt.scatter(x, y, s=10)
        plt.title('Page views in last month')
        plt.xlabel('Time')
        plt.ylabel('PV/hour')
        # set x ticks by week count
        plt.xticks([w*7*24 for w in range(10)], ['week %d'%w for w in range(10)])
        plt.autoscale(tight=True)
        plt.grid(True, linestyle='-', color='0.75')
        plt.show()
        ```

2. Feature Engineering
    In our case, 2-d data, skipped.

3. Data modeling
    + Having error function, we can compare the performance differences among models:
    
        ```python
        def error(f, x, y):
            return sp.sum(sp.power(f(x) - y, 2))
        ```

    + Let us try 1d fitting:
    
        ```python
        fp1 = sp.polyfit(x, y, 1)
        print fp1  # [   2.59619213  989.02487106]
        f1 = sp.poly1d(fp1)
        print type(f1)  # <class 'numpy.lib.polynomial.poly1d'>
        print f1  # 2.596 x + 989
        print error(f1, x, y)  # (317389767.34+0j)
        ```

    + Visualise 1d fitting:

        ```python
        fx = sp.linspace(0, x[-1], 1000)
        plt.plot(fx, f1(fx), color='green', linewidth=4)
        plt.legend(['d = %d' % f1.order], loc='upper left')
        ```
