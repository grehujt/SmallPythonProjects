# Making Prediction Based On Curve Fitting

_NOTE: this example is taken from **Building Machine Learning System in Python**._

### Key points
- Basic feelings on machine learning system.
    1. data cleaning
    2. feature engineering
    3. data modeling
    4. models evaluation
- Basic usages of curve fitting functions in scipy.
    + scipy.genfromtxt _(alias for [numpy.genfromtxt](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html))_
    + 
- Basic usages of data visualization of matplotlib.

### Scenario
- We are running a website, as time goes by, an increasing number of users are attracted by our website.
- We are going to allocate resources (more servers) to make our clients happy.
- But we do not want to waste money on allocating too many resources.
- We have a [tsv](./web_traffic.tsv) (tab-seperated values) file, which contains the web stats for last month. And each line contains the hour consecutively and number of page views in that hour.
- We want to know in advance when our current limit will be hit (10k requests per hour).

### Step-by-step solution
1. data cleaning
    + load & view the data:
    
        ```python
        data = sp.genfromtxt('web_traffic.tsv', delimiter='\t')
        print data.shape
        print data[:10]
        ```

        >     (743, 2)
        >     [[  1.00000000e+00   2.27200000e+03]
        >      [  2.00000000e+00              nan]
        >      [  3.00000000e+00   1.38600000e+03]
        >      [  4.00000000e+00   1.36500000e+03]
        >      [  5.00000000e+00   1.48800000e+03]
        >      [  6.00000000e+00   1.33700000e+03]
        >      [  7.00000000e+00   1.88300000e+03]
        >      [  8.00000000e+00   2.28300000e+03]
        >      [  9.00000000e+00   1.33500000e+03]
        >      [  1.00000000e+01   1.02500000e+03]]
    
    + find out if we can drop the 'nan' data:

        ```python
        x = data[:, 0]
        y = data[:, 1]
        print sp.sum(sp.isnan(y)) # 8
        ```

        In this case, we have 8 nan out of 743 samples, we can afford to drop them.

    + data clean up:
    
        ```python
        x = x[~sp.isnan(y)]
        y = y[~sp.isnan(y)]
        ```

    + visulise the data to get a feeling:

        ```python
        plt.scatter(x, y, s=10)
        plt.title('Page views in last month')
        plt.xlabel('Time')
        plt.ylabel('PV/hour')
        # set x ticks by week count
        plt.xticks([w*7*24 for w in range(10)], ['week %d'%w for w in range(10)])
        plt.autoscale(tight=True)
        plt.grid(True, linestyle='-', color='0.75')
        plt.show()
        ```
